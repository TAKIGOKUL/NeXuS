All Updates for the Online Campus Community Will Be Posted Here

This community is focused on engineering students in Kerala, encompassing those from underdeveloped colleges to top-tier institutions.

The goal is to create a platform that facilitates collaboration between junior and senior students on projects, enhancing and refining their work together. 

The design will be as user-friendly as possible, drawing inspiration from the interfaces of popular social media apps.

We are currently gathering data and resources for UI research.
